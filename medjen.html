The lady responsible for this is Ann Jennings. Some information from Ann herself is detailed below:</p><div class="box3">  <p align="center"><img src="images/Photo001.jpg" width="100" height="133" /></p>  </div><div align="justify">  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>My name is Ann Jennings and I am currently the Chairperson of the owner&rsquo;s Committee at Pergola and have been so since 1989.&nbsp; We have been owners since 1987. </p></div><p align="justify">I am married to Chris &ndash; who many of you may know as our Minute Secretary &ndash; we have two children (well adults now!).&nbsp; When I first became involved with the Pergola I was teaching full time college students, after this I moved on to work for a national charity as Head of F.E. and helping to set up a new centre here in the Midlands; after this I continued my career in teaching/training and finally become Education and training Manager for a national company.&nbsp; It was at this point my work and involvement with Pergola was increasing and I made a conscious decision to become more involved with Pergola and to do this on a full time basis incorporating Medjen as the collecting agents for maintenance fees.&nbsp;&nbsp; This I have now been doing for the last 11 years.</p><p align="justify">In September 2007 I took over as collecting Agent for the Solana Hotel too.&nbsp; In my role here I deal with all maintenance fee issues; general day to day queries/problems; your banking allocations; hopefully keep you all up to&nbsp; date with what&rsquo;s going on at Solana &hellip;</p><p class="body_text" align="justify">&nbsp;</p></div><div class="footer"><br/>© Copyright 2008 : Club Solana, design by : <a href="http://www.hddmarketing.com" target="_blank">HDD Creative</a></div></div></div><!-- Start of StatCounter Code --><script type="text/javascript">sc_project=3699951; sc_invisible=1; sc_partition=44; sc_security="152281fd"; </script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.statcounter.com/counter/counter_xhtml.js"></script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><a href="http://www.statcounter.com/" target="_blank"><img class="statcounter" src="http://c45.statcounter.com/3699951/0/152281fd/1/" alt="counter" ></a></div></noscript><!-- End of StatCounter Code --></body></html>
