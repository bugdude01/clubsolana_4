Final version of the Timeshare website.

OK, so here's the final version that went live in the latter part of 2008. Now structured a little better in a more confined space so
as to suit smaller screens and less garish colours than in previous versions. I now employed Flash animations to add a little interest to
the background without maing it too distracting. 

Again these were hand-built transitions and animations using Flash, Dreamweaver and Photoshop 7. 

Very proud of this version and even today, I still find it quite appealing.
