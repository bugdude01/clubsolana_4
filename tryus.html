Why not take a week in the sun to relax, unwind and discover the <strong>WORLDWIDE</strong> possibilities that await you.</p><p align="justify">To qualify for this programme you must meet the following requirements:</p><div align="justify">  <ul>      <li>Participants must be minimum 30 years of age, be married or living together for a period of minimum 3 years and one of the party must be in a full-time employment. </li>      <li>Your stay at our resort is at a reduced fee, but if the presentation is not attended by both parties, the full rental fee will be charged. </li>      <li>Your written confirmation must be brought along to show upon arrival. </li>      <li>The holiday accomodation is provided for a maximum of 4 people. </li>      <li>The Club Solana reserves the right to accomodate you in other resorts than ours, depending on availability. </li>  </ul></div><p align="justify">The offer is not open to current Club Solana/Pergola members. This is a one time offer only. The only obligation of this offer is that you spend a morning of your holiday time with us, where we will introduce you to our unique Holiday - Ownership concept. In a no obligation one-to-one tour we will simply point out the many benefits of Holiday - Ownership and explain why thousands of member families allow RCI to look after their holiday needs every year. </p><p align="justify">Please note that the sending of the accommodation request is not a confirmation of reservation. Your application will only be valid and binding once you receive a written response from the reservations department. At this point the accommodation fee will have been settled in full. Once a reservation has been confirmed there will be no refund in the event of cancellation. To ensure that flights can be matched to your accommodation we will issue a temporary confirmation valid for 3 working days to cover any amendments or cancellation of the reservation. If a cancellation is not received by the close of this period then your credit card will be charged with the full reservation cost.</p><h2 align="justify">Benefits of being a Member&nbsp; </h2><p align="justify"><strong>Flexibility - Hospitality - Guaranteed Standards</strong><br />    <br />  When you become an Solana Member, you gain access to an exclusive holiday club, which is just one of many benefits available to you.<br />  <br />  <strong>Flexibility - </strong>the freedom to visit your &ldquo;Home abroad&rdquo; at any time of the year, the choice is yours.<br />  <br />  <strong>Spread your holiday wings - </strong>through exchange to other four and five star resorts worldwide.
